    "# Kubernetes with Helm: Management Services for Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous post, we worked with Docker containers and used the Docker platform to deploy and manage containers. However, the Docker platform does not support advanced features or does not easily configure containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we need to update a container with the newest version of the core software or auto-scale the clusters of containers. In this case, Helm works very well with Kubernetes to manage containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation of terms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Container**: Services are packaged into different containers that run on the same or different hosts, but have isolated environments and dependencies.\n",
    "* **Docker**: is a containerization platform that allows us to pack our applications into containers.\n",
    "* **Kubernetes (K8s)**: a container orchestration system that is for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.\n",
    "* **Helm**: package manager for Kubernetes by using **Helm Chart**. "
